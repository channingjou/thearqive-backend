Contribution Rules

‚úîÔ∏è Never work on master branch!


‚úîÔ∏è Create a new branch for each set of related bugs or set of related tasks, naming by:


type_PascalCase, example: feat_CareerPage, bug_CareerEmail.


Common short type tokens: wip (work in progress), feat (feature or design), bug (bug fixes)


üíª command to create new branch locally: git checkout -b bug_CareerEmail


‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Before creating a branch, check if someone already started to work on this task and if there's already a branch created for this task, and if there is, please checkout and track the branch with the üíª command: git checkout --track origin/bug_CareerEmail


--track shorthand for git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch] where remote name is origin and branch is the specific branch you're pulling from the origin remote


Right after creating a new branch, push it to remote to make it available for everyone, defining the upstream


üíª command: git push -u origin bug_CareerEmail


‚úîÔ∏è Everyday after working, push your local branch updates to remote branch.


‚ö†Ô∏è Important: make sure you're on the correct branch... and push


With üíª command: git push


‚úîÔ∏è Finished with the task and want to merge?


Fix conflicts if needed, usually happens when more than 1 developer is working on the same file on different branches - communicate with the other developer to make sure their work was not removed


Please make the merge/pull request with as much detail about what you've done/added.


Or lead will merge your branch to master for you. Just ask!
